{{ en.RDM }} generates ancillary files on your workstation. The table below lists out an example of ancillary files and their locations.

As described in [Configuration file location](/rdm/windows/installation/client/configuration-file-location/), the default path for most of these files are customizable. For this reason, we use the \[CONFIG\] token in this documentation to denote when a file is stored in a configuration folder that can be relocated, or the \[PROFILE\] token to indicate that they are stored in the local profile. By default, these point to the same exact folder. The only method to separate them is by using a customized configuration.

Since you can also deploy on a portable device, sometimes known as using the XCOPY deployment model, we will use the \[INSTALLDIR\] token to indicate that the file is in the same location as {{ en.RDM }}.

The Override Source column indicates if an available mechanism can relocate the files of that category elsewhere.
