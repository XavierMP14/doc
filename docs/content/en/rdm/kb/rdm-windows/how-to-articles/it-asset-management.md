### IT asset management

Manage your ***IT inventory***  by centralizing technical, software, hardware, and location information.

The IT Asset Management feature can be used to link an asset manager (e.g., BlueTally, [Lansweeper](/rdm/kb/rdm-windows/how-to-articles/lansweeper/)) through an entry's properties. {% snippet, "badgeInfo" %}Only the ***Session***, ***Remote Management***, ***Miscellaneous***, ***VPN***, ***Synchronizer*** and ***Template*** entry types support this feature for now.
