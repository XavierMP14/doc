  title: '{{ en.WBEX }} user interface with {{ en.DVLS }}'
---
The {{ en.WBEX }} user interface is slightly different in your browser depending on the Devolutions product used in conjunction with the extension. This topic will present the {{ en.WBEX }} user interface when used with {{ en.DVLS }}.

The main view, which is the one displayed when first opening the {{ en.WBEX }} in your browser, can be divided into two main sections:

1. The ***Side menu*** gives you access to some {{ en.WBEX }} functionalities and settings. It is directly linked to the central panel, as each tab changes what is displayed in the window depending on its function.
2. The ***Content area*** is where information will be displayed and where you can interact with {{ en.WBEX }} functionalities corresponding to the different tabs. ![User interface sections](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/WEBX4056_2024_2.png "User interface sections")

### Side menu and Content Area

If you use multiple Devolutions products with the extension, you can switch between them using the ***Space selector*** at the top of the ***Side menu***. A drop-down list will appear with the other products you have previously paired with the {{ en.WBEX }}. ![Space selector](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/WEBX4057_2024_2.png "Space selector") At the bottom of the ***Side menu***, the ***Settings*** button opens a new tab in which you can configure your extension. Consult the [full settings list](/workspace/workspace-browser-extension/settings/). ![Settings button](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/WEBX4058_2024_2.png "Settings button")

Using the tabs of the ***Side menu***, you can access various {{ en.WBEX }} features. ![Side menu tabs](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/WEBX4059_2024_2.png "Side menu tabs") Each tab will display a different view in the ***Content area***. The tabs available when using the {{ en.WBEX }} with {{ en.DVLS }} are:

* the ***Matching*** tab, where you can find available credentials for a specific website.
* the ***{{ en.VLT }}*** tab,  where you can find all the {{ en.DVLS }} entries you synchronized, divided into your different {{ en.VLT }}s and folders.
* the ***Favorites*** tab, where you can find a list of your favorite entries.
* the ***Recent*** tab, where you can find a list of the entries that you recently used.
* the ***Password Generator*** tab, where you can create a strong and secure password for a new account.

Next to the [***Add website***](https://docs.devolutions.net/workspace/workspace-browser-extension/devolutions-server/user-interface/side-menu/add-website/) button is your ***Account*** button. This section has some useful links and information, namely:

* a ***Log off*** button to sign out of your {{ en.DA }}.
* a link to your {{ en.DVLS }}.
* a link to our [{{ en.DVLS }} Forum](https://forum.devolutions.net/product/server).
* a link to our [{{ en.DVLS }} documentation (Online Help)](/server/).
* the current version of the {{ en.WBEX }}.
