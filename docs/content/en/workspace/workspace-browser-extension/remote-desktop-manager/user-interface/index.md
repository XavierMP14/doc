The {% var, "WBEX" false %} user interface is slightly different depending on the Devolutions product used in conjunction with it. This topic will present the {% var, "WBEX" false %} user interface when used with {% var, "RDM" false %}.

The main view, which is the one displayed when first opening the {% var, "WBEX" false %} in your browser, can be divided into three main sections:

1. The ***Side menu*** gives you access to some {% var, "WBEX" false %} functionalities and settings. It is directly linked to the central panel, as each tab changes what is displayed in the window depending on its function.
2. The ***Content area*** is where information will be displayed and where you can interact with {% var, "WBEX" false %} functionalities corresponding to the different tabs.

### Side Menu and Content area

If you use multiple Devolutions products with the extension, you can switch between them using the ***Space Selector*** at the left of the ***SideMenu***. A drop-down list will appear with the other products you have previously paired with the {% var, "WBEX" false %}.<br>![Space selector](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/WEBX4009_2024_2.png "Space selector")

At the bottom of the ***Side Menu***, the ***Settings*** button opens a new tab in which you can configure your extension. Consult the [full settings list](/workspace/workspace-browser-extension/settings/).<br>![Settings button](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/WEBX4010_2024_2.png "Settings button")

Using the tabs of the ***Side menu***, you can access various {% var, "WBEX" false %} features. ![Side menu tabs](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/WEBX4011_2024_2.png "Side menu tabs")

Each tab will display a different view in the ***Content Area***. The tabs available when using the {% var, "WBEX" false %} with {% var, "RDM" false %} are:

* the ***Matching*** tab, where you can find available credentials for a specific website.
* the ***Password Generator*** tab, where you can create a strong and secure password for a new account.
* the ***About*** tab, where you will find links to useful tools and information about the {% var, "WBEX" false %}.
